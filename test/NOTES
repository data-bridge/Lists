Something like Files.cpp from Build:
- Filename with whole path, starting from a directory
- All txt files other than doubles and nosplits
- Annotated by category (may be none) and sub

Should do timing

Direct call at string level

Could perhaps multi-thread, but probably fast enough as it is

Words class
- store(word, cat, sub, mpron, metaphone1..4)
- All kinds of stats
- counts{cat}{sub} number, right1..4
- marginal counts{cat}, {sub}
- Collisions{cat}{meta1..4}: List of words and sub
- Count these as measure of quality





* Metaphone itself
  - Maybe some special characters should get pronunciation!

* Turn pronunciation into Metaphone3.
* Run C++ against pronunciation.

* Try other files from web (also BBODB output).
* Which extended/UTF8 characters occur at all?

* Run single files against themselves for identical strings
  (duplicates, or false positives?)
* Run different files against each other for identical strings
  (players appearing in more than one file, or false positives?)
* Set up format with scrapers and manipulators in Github,
  raw data (later compressed) on data

* Make format for names
  - Look at BBODB
  - Should contain gender
    . Mixed/women's tournaments
    . Women's and not men's first names
    . Maybe Google image!
