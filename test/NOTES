* Try reading in the cons/vowel files, compare with originals, no change?

* Statistics on pieces
  cons                     vowel
  # %  easy/hard# cnt %
1
2
3

5

easy means pkr = p/k/r or PKR (hard consonants only)
hard means rest

* Generate collision files for real and meta
* Look at real collisions by hand
* Make statistics
  - real collisions that do or don't collapse in metapron as well
  - If none that don't collapse, then the reals are "one word"
  - Statistics on avg collisions by histogram
  - Metapron can't be expected to untangle real collisions,
    but the other ones are new

Direct call at string level

Could perhaps multi-thread, but probably fast enough as it is


* Metaphone itself
  - Maybe some special characters should get pronunciation!

* Try other files from web (also BBODB output).
* Which extended/UTF8 characters occur at all?

* Run single files against themselves for identical strings
  (duplicates, or false positives?)
* Run different files against each other for identical strings
  (players appearing in more than one file, or false positives?)
* Set up format with scrapers and manipulators in Github,
  raw data (later compressed) on data

* Make format for names
  - Look at BBODB
  - Should contain gender
    . Mixed/women's tournaments
    . Women's and not men's first names
    . Maybe Google image!
