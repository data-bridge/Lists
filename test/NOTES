Don't show upper/lower case collisions if the same realpron
Why do words make it that have different prons only?
  Because metapron maps them to the same mpron.
Eliminate duplicates for one word, e.g. "the"
Propose lines for identical pronunciations to copy to top,
  avoiding allowed collisions ("X therefor therefore" for
  easy filtering afterwards)
When printing collisions, empty line after each group

When mapping written words to realpron, divide into runs
of consonants and non-consonants.  Have a list of realprons
for each run.  Recursively try to decompose realpron.
Expand the lists until we've got them all.  Count how many
of each we get.  Print.  Use the strong favorites in Metapron
to map vowels to A, E, I, O, U, Y, 1-9 or so.

make the list in Extract.cpp a file to read in?

Hgaboskey might be Hra...?

Bedjaouni is probably Bedjaoui

Lexell should probably be k/s

Hwajung should probably be j not r

Egan is not djougz in northam/last.txt

Georgiev maybe Georghiev

spleughan with "K" (k) not "F"

skip VSTOL

ending on -ence etc:
metapron3 favors NTS, mpron NS
Add the T

almshouse etc:
metapron favors AMSS, mpron AMSHS
Remove the H

armhole:
ARML vs AMHL...
remove H

barhop:
PRP vs RRHP
remove H

bathhouse:
P0S vs P0HS

Something like Files.cpp from Build:
- Filename with whole path, starting from a directory
- All txt files other than doubles and nosplits
- Annotated by category (may be none) and sub

Should do timing

Direct call at string level

Could perhaps multi-thread, but probably fast enough as it is

Words class
- store(word, cat, sub, mpron, metaphone1..4)
- All kinds of stats
- counts{cat}{sub} number, right1..4
- marginal counts{cat}, {sub}
- Collisions{cat}{meta1..4}: List of words and sub
- Count these as measure of quality





* Metaphone itself
  - Maybe some special characters should get pronunciation!

* Turn pronunciation into Metaphone3.
* Run C++ against pronunciation.

* Try other files from web (also BBODB output).
* Which extended/UTF8 characters occur at all?

* Run single files against themselves for identical strings
  (duplicates, or false positives?)
* Run different files against each other for identical strings
  (players appearing in more than one file, or false positives?)
* Set up format with scrapers and manipulators in Github,
  raw data (later compressed) on data

* Make format for names
  - Look at BBODB
  - Should contain gender
    . Mixed/women's tournaments
    . Women's and not men's first names
    . Maybe Google image!
