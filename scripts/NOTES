Pronunciation
=============

* Split plaintext into words with encodings (word, line number, encoding)
* Sort output
* Look for words with different encodings (ignore case)
* Fix in mpron.txt until no more problems

* Look for words that are prefixes of other words,
  encodings should be too

* Look at pairs of successive sounds in single words (csv matrix)
* Script can extract
  - All occurrences of specific word (word, line number, encoding)
  - Ditto of a sounds string "E/n" etc.

* Make conclusive lists of sounds and encodings
