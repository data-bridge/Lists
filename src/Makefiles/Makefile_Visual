# This the Metapron3 Makefile for Windows and the Microsoft Visual C++
# compiler.  It assumes a Unix-like setup for some commands.

# The "windres" and "cvtres" tools are used for putting version
# information into the DLL in a way that Windows can see.
# It is not mandatory, and if you don't have those tools,
# You can remove $(VFILE).obj in the target line below.


# ----------------------- OFTEN OK    ------------------------------

# From here on you you don't have to change anything to CONFIGURE
# the compilation.  But you may well have to change something to 
# get it to compile.
