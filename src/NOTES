* Metaphone itself
  - Loop: Could be dispatch function
  - Space is new word (not single string)
  - No more tokenize in test then
  - Maybe some special characters should get pronunciation!

* Turn pronunciation into Metaphone3.
* Run C++ against pronunciation.

* Try other files from web (also BBODB output).
* Which extended/UTF8 characters occur at all?

* Run single files against themselves for identical strings
  (duplicates, or false positives?)
* Run different files against each other for identical strings
  (players appearing in more than one file, or false positives?)
* Set up format with scrapers and manipulators in Github,
  raw data (later compressed) on data

* Make format for names
  - Look at BBODB
  - Should contain gender
    . Mixed/women's tournaments
    . Women's and not men's first names
    . Maybe Google image!
